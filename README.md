I specialize in machine learning - mostly with supervision.
I create regression models and classification models. He also specializes in creating optimization algorithms using the
operational programming method. I freely program in Python in Jupyter notebook, I use GitHub and GitLab. I use object-
oriented programming. I also use neural network deep learning techniques from the Pytorch library for classification and
regression. It does not deal with image processing and NLP.

I use models from the Sklearn library for classification: GaussianNB, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Classifier,
Random Forest Classifier, Kneighbors Classifier, Support Vector Classifier.
From other libraries of gradient boosting models: LGBM Classifier, Cat Boost Classifier, XGB Classifier
I use models for regression from the library Sklearn:
K-Neighbors Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, Bagging Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, Linear Regression,
AdaBoost Regressor, Ridge, Huber Regressor,Elastic Net CV, ExtraTreesRegressor, Random Forest Regressor, Support
Vector Regression

For operational programming algorithms I use libraries: Pulp, Cvxopt
For the graphical presentation of data I use libraries: Seaborn, Matplotlib
For general use, I use the libraries: Pandas, Scipy, Numpy, Beautifultable, Tabulate, Statmodels, Shap, Fractions

I can use the SQL query language and a spreadsheet.
I work in the Ubuntu environment on a daily basis, I carried out the vast majority of projects with teams, we used GitHub
and GitLab version control solutions.

I work with bands in Polish, English and Russian. He is fluent in these languages.
